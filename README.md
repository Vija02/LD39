Think fast and explore efficiently if you want to make it out alive!

## Technical Details
This game is made using **React**, bootstrapped with create-react-app.
It is hosted with github, so you can find the HTML files in the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. 

No game engine was used and everything was developed from scratch in the span of 48 hours. This project also demonstrates the power of CSS grid in its infancy.
